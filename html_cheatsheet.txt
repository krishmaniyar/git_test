Attributres

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a> -> target defines where to open the link.
 
href specifies the destination link, target specifies where the linked resource will be opened. 
If it is not present, then, by default, it will take on the _self value which opens the link in the current tab. 
To open the link in a new tab or window (depends on browser settings) you can set it to _blank as follows.

You may have noticed that we snuck in the rel attribute above. 
This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.
The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. 
The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well.

<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600"> -> to show image.
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket"> -> The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image get an understanding of what the image contains.
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p> -> style attribute to add style to our text.
<p title="I'm a tooltip">The title attribute as a tooltip.</p> -> The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.
